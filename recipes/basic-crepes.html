            <li>1c All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2Tbsp Butter (melted)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a
                large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and Whisk
                vigorously until smooth</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over
                 medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter 
                onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. 
                Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the 
                batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and 
                the bottom has turned light 
                brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the 
                skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other 
                side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Serve hot. Enjoy!</li>        
        </ol>
