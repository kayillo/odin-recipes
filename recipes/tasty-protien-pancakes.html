    <h1>Tasty Protien Pancakes</h1>
    <p>Pancakes that have loads of protein and yet taste great! 
        Serve with either maple syrup or a spoonful of Greek yogurt 
        with honey.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1c whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4tsp salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>1c low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4c low-fat milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour, baking soda, cinnamon, 
            and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk cottage cheese, milk, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl. Pour into the flour mixture; whisk until batter is just combined; it will be thick.</li>
        <li>Heat an oiled griddle over medium-high heat; when a water drop on the surface dances and sizzles, it's ready. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle. Cook until golden brown and bubbles break the surface, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn and cook until set, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Eat every bite!</li>
    </ol>
